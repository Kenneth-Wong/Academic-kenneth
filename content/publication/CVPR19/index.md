# Abstract.
abstract = "Relationship is the core of scene graph, but its prediction is far from satisfying because of its complex visual diversity. To alleviate this problem, we treat relationship as an abstract object, exploring not only significative visual pattern but contextual information for it, which are two key aspects when considering object recognition. Our observation on current datasets reveals that there exists intimate association among relationships. Therefore, inspired by the successful application of context to object-oriented tasks, we especially construct context for relationships where all of them are gathered so that the recognition could benefit from their association. Moreover, accurate recognition needs discriminative visual pattern for object, and so does relationship. In order to discover effective pattern for relationship, traditional relationship feature extraction methods such as using union region or combination of subject-object feature pairs are replaced with our proposed intersection region which focuses on more essential parts. Therefore, we present our so-called Relationship Context - InterSeCtion Region (CISC) method. Experiments for scene graph generation on Visual Genome dataset and visual relationship prediction on VRD dataset indicate that both the relationship context and intersection region improve performances and realize anticipated functions."
