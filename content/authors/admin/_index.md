I'm *Kenneth Wong*, namely *Wenbin Wang* (王文彬), a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Key Lab. of Intelligent Information Processing (IIP)](http://vipl.ict.ac.cn/) at [Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)](http://www.ict.ac.cn/), advised by Prof. [Xilin Chen](http://vipl.ict.ac.cn/people/~xlchen) and Prof. [Ruiping Wang](http://vipl.ict.ac.cn/homepage/rpwang/index.htm). My research interests lie in the field of Computer Vision, especially in enabling intelligent agents to sense and understand a real scene as we humans do. Before this, I was an undergraduate student of [Nankai University](https://www.nankai.edu.cn/) (NKU, 2013 - 2017), and received my B.Eng. degree in Computer Science and Technology.

I have a great fondness for sports besides my academia work. I'm deeply passionate about badminton and basketball.  “Hopefully what you get from tonight is that those times when you get up early and you work hard; those times when you stay up late and you work hard; those times when don’t feel like working — you’re too tired, you don’t want to push yourself — but you do it anyway. That is actually the dream. That’s the dream.” Tribute to Mamba spirit.
